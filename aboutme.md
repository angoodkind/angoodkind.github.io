I am a PhD student in the [Media, Technology, and Society program](https://communication.northwestern.edu/programs/phd_media_technology_society), an interdisciplinary program within Northwestern's [School of Communications](https://communication.northwestern.edu).Â  I was formerly a PhD student in the Linguistics Department.

My research centers around understanding user experiences, where an "experience" can be explicitly expressed (behavior) or implicitly thought about (cognition). By approaching "experiences" from both angles, I am able to gain a more profound appreciation of what a user is going through, by understanding their actions and thoughts.

My thesis focuses on keystroke dynamics, or the timing patterns of typing, in online conversations. Keystrokes provide a great example of my two-pronged approach: From a behavioral standpoint, I can see exactly what is being produced, e.g. a final message. But I can also understand *how* the message is being produced, e.g. mistakes or typing really quickly, to understand the mindset and motivation behind the message.

## My history

I received my MA from the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://gc.cuny.edu/Home) in [Computational Linguistics](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Linguistics/About-the-Program/Specializations/Computational-Linguistics), where I worked on keystroke dynamics with [Andrew Rosenberg](http://eniac.cs.qc.cuny.edu/andrew/) and [David-Guy Brizan](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/david-guy-brizan).

Before that, I received my BA in Religion from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), with a focus on Science & Religion from Columbia University. Through my work on narrative summarization with [Becky Passonneau](https://sites.psu.edu/becky/), I became interested in linguistics and how we can use these markers to improve communication.
