I am a PhD student in the [Media, Technology, and Society program](https://communication.northwestern.edu/programs/phd_media_technology_society), an interdisciplinary program within Northwestern's [School of Communications](https://communication.northwestern.edu).Â  I was formerly a PhD student in the Linguistics Department.

## My history

I received my MA from the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://gc.cuny.edu/Home) in [Computational Linguistics](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Linguistics/About-the-Program/Specializations/Computational-Linguistics), where I worked on keystroke dynamics with [Andrew Rosenberg](http://eniac.cs.qc.cuny.edu/andrew/) and [David-Guy Brizan](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/david-guy-brizan).

Before that, I received my BA in Religion from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), with a focus on Science & Religion from Columbia University. Through my work on narrative summarization with [Becky Passonneau](https://sites.psu.edu/becky/), I became interested in linguistics and how we can use these markers to improve communication.
