  <img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/23/75/21/5231741/5/628x471.jpg" width="263" height="377" />Have you ever been handed a rough draft of a paper by a friend, who says, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t edited it yet, could you take a look at it?&#8221; Translation: &#8220;My time is more valuable than your time, so could you complete a task I&#8217;ve deemed myself too important to complete?&#8221; That sums up how I felt the entire time I was read Eggers&#8217; <em>The Circle</em>. It reads like a desperate attempt to be a modern day <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, with flat characters who go on long diatribes.

But then I noticed something&#8230;

Every time I logged onto Facebook, I felt kind of ridiculous. The ridiculousness of _The Circle_, that I couldn&#8217;t stand, was staring me in the face.

And then, I saw this headline: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-officemax-mail-20140119,0,6457094.story#axzz2qubhydAY" target="_blank">Dad gets OfficeMax mail addressed &#8216;Daughter Killed in Car Crash&#8217;</a>. (Go ahead, take a moment to read the article.)

I really don&#8217;t know how to proceed at the moment. I don&#8217;t want to become an off-the-grid radical (and heck, I like blogging!). I know it&#8217;s <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5892422/how-to-quickly-read-a-terms-of-service" target="_blank">impossible</a> to read every Terms of Service I &#8216;Accept.&#8217; But clearly I need to be more wary of my privacy than the societally-accepted default.

In the mean time, read _The Circle_. While it would have been nice if Eggers&#8217; had given his book a second pass, I can forgive him since he gave the world <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Heartbreaking_Work_of_Staggering_Genius" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McSweeney%27s_Quarterly_Concern" target="_blank">this</a>.

One thing that annoyed me, though. Towards the end of the book, Eggers writes:

> <font size="2"></p> 
> 
> <div style="line-height:70%">
>   Then on Friday (the only day the post office still delivered)&#8230;
> </div></blockquote> 
> 
> <p style="text-align: justify;">
>   Why Friday?? Mail is 99% business-related, so wouldn&#8217;t Monday make more sense?
