A couple months ago, I couldn&#8217;t catch the series finale of _How I Met Your Mother_ the night it aired. I didn&#8217;t want any spoilers, so I challenged myself to stay off of any news/social media sites the next day, until I could watch the finale.

Needless to say, my self-imposed ban led to a dramatic increase in productivity. I spent more time doing work, and felt more focused when I was engaged in that work. A few weeks ago, I had a similar experience when working from a coffee shop with crappy wifi. By not being able to easily log onto site like reddit or even &#8220;helpful&#8221; sites like StackOverflow, I was forced to be more attentive to the task at hand. It inspired me to make this chart:

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-148 aligncenter" src="http://adamgoodkind.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/productivity-300x204.jpg" alt="productivity" width="300" height="204" srcset="http://adamgoodkind.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/productivity-300x204.jpg 300w, http://adamgoodkind.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/productivity.jpg 406w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://adamgoodkind.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/productivity.jpg)

Ubiquitous wifi is a blessing and a curse. It&#8217;s great to be able to access anything from anywhere but I don&#8217;t think our brains are wired for that. In my linguistics class, _Introduction to Sentence Processing_, we learned about how &#8220;lazy&#8221; our mental sentence processor is, and how, as soon as it can form a phrase, it does (rather than considering all hypothetical syntactic options). This leads to errors such as:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>The horse raced past the barn fell</em><em>.</em>
</p>

This is called a garden-path sentence, and has been studied extensively. The uptake, I believe, is that our minds are naturally averse to hard work. If a detour, distraction, or vacation is readily available, our instinctual minds (_id_) will take it, quicker than our disciplined mind (_ego_/_super-ego_) can overrule it.

I&#8217;m sure there are 100s of productivity &#8220;hacks&#8221; meant to overcome this obstacle. But, for me, just being cognizant of it is the most powerful &#8220;hack.&#8221;

Now, I just need to publish this, and post it on facebook, twitter, reddit&#8230;crap&#8230;
