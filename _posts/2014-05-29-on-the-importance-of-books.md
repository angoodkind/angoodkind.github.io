My inspiration to write this post came from [LeVar Burton&#8217;s incredible Kickstarter campaign to bring back &#8220;Reading Rainbow&#8221;](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/readingrainbow/bring-reading-rainbow-back-for-every-child-everywh/). The fact that the campaign raised over $1 million in less than 24 hours is a powerful testament to how important the show was, and, more importantly, the power of books. Although reading is on the decline<span style="color: #0000ff;"><sup>[citation needed]</sup></span>, and there are very real advantages to digital books, I believe that dead-tree books occupy an irreplaceable role in our lives.<img class="alignright" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/EastOfEden.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="410" />

Last week, in a fit of procrastination, I cataloged and alphabetized all of the books on my bookshelf. After 4 moves in 5 years, I&#8217;m down to a measly 39; in a previous life, I had a whole wall of books. If you&#8217;d like to peruse my virtual bookshelf, [have fun](http://adamgoodkind.com/bookshelf/ "Bookshelf").

As I was cataloging the books, though, the medium&#8217;s importance began to hit me. Each book brought back memories. For instance, Tom Robbins&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fierce Invalids Return From Hot Climates</span> was recommended to me at the perfect moment, as I was going through my college/adolescence-crisis-of-faith phase. Mr. Robbins&#8217; canon was instrumental in supporting me through that journey. Bruce Chatwin&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Songlines</span> was given to me by a great college professor, and was the first book that made me think about linguistics, essentially shaping the trajectory of my life.

Physical books are coated in memories, in a way I doubt digital books will ever be. It isn&#8217;t just about which pages we dog-eared, and what marginalia we recorded, but rather, a much more visceral connection. My most poignant book memory came from John Steinbeck&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">East of Eden</span>. I read it when I was losing my hearing, when my world was being torn apart. The ending struck me deeply, and it was the first book that ever made me cry. A few months later, my grandfather died, and my grandmother let me have any books I wanted from his bookshelf. Among his long wall of books, I discovered a 1st Edition copy of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">East of Eden</span>. It was a beautiful moment, when I felt the book connecting us through time.

None of this is to say that digitization is anything short of miraculous. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I would sooner give up my smartphone than give up my Kindle. Rather, books are a medium we can never wholly convert to bits and bytes, 1s and 0s. If we only focus on a book&#8217;s text, we&#8217;ll lose a critical link in our society: A book can sometimes be more than a book, and I never want to digitize that.
