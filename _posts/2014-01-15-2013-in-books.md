First off, let it be known that I completely stole this idea from a fellow grad student, [Robin](http://www.robincamille.com/2014-01-02-books-i-read-in-2013/). It sounded like a fun idea, and since almost all of these were on my Kindle, pulling up the list took all of 15 seconds.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistics</span>:

  * I read 6 non-fiction books, and 23 works of fiction
  * 2 authors (Lee Child and Neal Stephenson) accounted for 12 (33%) books
  * 30% of what I read (11 books) could be classified as science fiction
  * I had no idea that I read so many Jack Reacher books. I did a ton of unpleasant, frequent airport travel in the first half of the year, and the mindless gluttony of the books, combined with short chapters, made them ideal for airport lounges and seat 3B. Nevertheless, I feel like a person who just mindlessly ate an entire bag of potato chips, and is now staring at the empty bag.
