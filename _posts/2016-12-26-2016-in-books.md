I felt I did a lot of reading, but I guess it didn&#8217;t amount to a lot of books. Some of them took me a while to get through. For example,&nbsp;_The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August_ was by far the best book I read in 2016, but it also took a while to get through. I suppose that moving to my year primarily consisted of:

  * Applying to grad schools programs and attending visiting days/weekends all across the country.
  * Writing an MA thesis
  * Moving to a brand new city
  * Starting a new PhD program in linguistics

So it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m without excuses. But still, I wish I had read more. I do think I read a lot of linguistics/machine learning/cogitive science papers, and wish I had tracked those better.&nbsp;

As always, credit for this idea goes to Robin. Her 2015 list can be found [here](http://www.robincamille.com/2016-01-12-books-i-read-in-2015/). The only useful tool I&#8217;ve found for converting an Amazon library to a list can be found [here](https://www.ardenstone.com/2015/01/11/exporting-kindle-books-from-amazon/). Surprisingly, or not, Amazon makes exporting this list tremendously difficult.

Nonetheless, here are the books I read this year, in reverse chronological order:
