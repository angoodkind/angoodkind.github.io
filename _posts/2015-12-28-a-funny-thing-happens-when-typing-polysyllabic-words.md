Over the holidays I&#8217;ve been emptying my <a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">digital pockets</a> and finding all sorts of fun nick-nacks. In particular, <a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Public-Health-(DPH)/Faculty-Bios/Jessie-Daniels" target="_blank">Jessie Daniels</a> <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/09/25/how-to-be-a-scholar-daniels/" target="_blank">describes how to be a scholar now, when peer-reviewed articles can begin as Tweets and blog posts</a>. Taking up her clarion call, I thought I&#8217;d give it a shot.

[<span style="color: #ff0000;">Warning:</span> _These findings are minimal and preliminary. A much more thorough analysis needs to be done, and many many more statistical tests need to be run._]

I&#8217;ve been meaning to study variation in language production, specifically on a word-by-word basis. For example, how does one typist or one population of typists produce the word _giraffe_ versus another typist or population of typists?

I took a few polysyllabic words from the word list used by <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mll/" target="_blank">Molly Lewis</a> & <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/" target="_blank">Michael C. Frank</a> in their recent paper _<a href="http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers_new/lewis-2015-underrev.pdf" target="_blank">The length of words reflects their conceptual complexity</a>, _and measured the pause times (intervals) before each letter. Here are the results:

<a href="http://adamgoodkind.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Prelim_Pause_Times.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-650"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-650" src="http://adamgoodkind.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Prelim_Pause_Times-300x186.jpg" alt="Prelim_Pause_Times" width="468" height="290" srcset="http://adamgoodkind.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Prelim_Pause_Times-300x186.jpg 300w, http://adamgoodkind.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Prelim_Pause_Times.jpg 468w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a>

The first thing to note is that pauses before a word are much longer than pauses within a word. This finding is well-established, though.

More interesting (to me, at least) is what happens at syllable boundaries. In the two compound words _because_ and _someone_, the pause at the syllable boundary is more pronounced. An unpaired t-test shows a significant difference in pause times between syllable-liminal and syllable-internal pause times (_p _< 0.01), whereas differences between other syllable-internal pauses are not significant.

In typing research, a more pronounced pause time indicates &#8220;more cognition&#8221; is happening. There is some process, such as downloading a word into the lexical buffer, that causes a slowdown in figuring out which key to strike next. It is possible that we are observing a phenomenon where lexical retrieval occurs at the syllable level when a word is made up of multiple words, even if those words do not &#8220;compose&#8221; the compound word.

Specifically, the word _someone_ can reasonably be decomposed into _some_ + _one_. It might make sense that _someone_ is downloaded syllable-by-syllable, and we see that delay in typing as the next word/syllable is retrieved.

More surprisingly, though, we do not think of _because_ as being composed of _be_ + _cause_, even though these are two perfectly good words. Nonetheless, we see ___something__ _happening when the next word/syllable is retrieved.

None of these delays, though, are observed in the words _people_ and _about_, although I supposed _about_ = _a _+ _bout_.

tl;dr: Something fun is going on with multisyllabic, compound words. It needs a lot more investigation, and I plan on doing just that over the holidays.
