My favorite gem is from Dwight Schrute, when he recounts the best advice he was ever given: <em>Don&#8217;t be an idiot</em>. He then expands upon this nugget:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <em>Before I do anything, I ask myself, &#8220;Would an idiot do that?&#8221; And if the answer is yes, I do not do that thing.</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Yes, this is Dwight being Dwight. But there is wisdom to be gained from this notion, which I am [proud/embarrassed] to admit I think about frequently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  When working &#8212; be it programming, linguistics, writing, etc. &#8212; it&#8217;s easy enough to burn out. If a program isn&#8217;t working as expected, I might try changing variables, at random, in a desperate attempt to get it to work. Or, worse, I&#8217;ll sit there staring at my screen.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is how an idiot works
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Good ideas rarely happen when you&#8217;re doing the same thing over and over again, e.g. flipping variables or staring blankly. If I catch myself in this sort of loop, I will, a la Dwight, stop doing That Thing. The stopping of That Thing can mean doing <em>anything</em> that is not That Thing, from stretching/walking around, to getting a cup of coffee, to going grocery shopping. The main idea is, The Thing I am doing, or my current approach to The Thing, is not working. Only an idiot would keep trying the same approach to The Thing, and expect a different, or more successful, outcome.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  And the funny thing is, this works! If I&#8217;m stuck on a programming problem that I&#8217;m sure is unsolvable, it&#8217;s uncanny how often the solution presents itself 2 minutes after I return from my break. I guess it pays to not be an idiot.
