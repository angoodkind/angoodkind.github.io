Isn&#8217;t this the same Adam Goodkind who, in 11th grade, took on a formal debate on why women are inherently inferior to men?&#8221; To my perplexed readers, Yes, it is one and the same.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Today was the 2nd annual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/ArtAndFeminism">art+feminism edit-a-thon</a>. The idea is to fix the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772">inherent male bias in wikipedia</a>, Participants selected a female artist, and either bulked up her wikipedia page or created one. (My contribution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jae_Rhim_Lee)
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  My inspiration to participate was partially to understand more about the wikipedia editing and creation process, but also partially to advance the feminist cause. Here&#8217;s why:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As someone with a disability, I have been the victim of discrimination on more than one occasion. It sucks, a lot. And my personal belief about how to change minds is, you need to change the ground truths. I do not believe that events like corporate-sponsored &#8220;Diversity & You&#8221;  seminars are effective in making real change.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Rather, you need to change the fundamental truths, from the ground-source up. This is a painstakingly slow process, like drops of water slowly eroding a rock into a canyon, but I firmly believe it is the only way to make a real impact.

  Wikipedia edit-a-thon&#8217;s are exactly what we need to make these changes real, and I applaud the Wikimedia Foundation for supporting it.

  [As a footnote, I really wanted to work on the page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Glennie">Evelyn Glennie</a>, a deaf percussionist, but her page is already pretty substantial.]
