## Current Projects
__Linguistics and Autism__

* Converting clinical transcripts into word vectors, we analyze semantic similarity in both typically-developing children (TD) and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our initial findings show that the cosine differences between children with ASD and TD children are significantly different when compared to a gold standard

__Using Language Models to Understand Cognition__

* Do better language models better predict cognitive processes measured by eye-tracking? Using a neural net-based language model, we use generalized additive models (GAMs) to investigate how language models with lower perplexity can better model eye-tracking data. We are also investigating the distinct influence of lower-level (local) statistics such as transitional probability versus surprisalâ€™s effects on processing.

## Past Research

__Keystroke Dynamics__
* Typing patterns are unique to individuals. Just as everyone has a unique voice, such as pitch, rate of speech, and vocabulary, everyone has a unique way of typing. We frame typing patterns by the keystroke's linguistic context, such as the word within which the keystroke was produced, or that word's lexical category. For example, a typist might produce <em>TH</em> differently in a noun versus in a verb.
<br>We utilize keystroke dynamics for two tasks: individual identification and cohort identification. The first task uses keystroke dynamics to better identify an individual. The latter task uses keystroke dynamics to try to predict a typist's demographics, e.g. native language or gender, from their typing patterns.<br>

* Some questions that still vex me:
  * How do temporal patterns surrounding typing reflect cognition and language familiarity?
  * Why do we pause in the midst of typing?
  * Do certain linguistic phenomena induce pauses in typing?

__Multi-word Expressions__
* Multi-word expressions (MWEs) are phrases such as "kick the bucket" or "a lot" which are made up of multiple words but are single lexical units. I study how we store and retrieve these types of lexical units in working memory. According to current hypotheses, MWEs are stored as a single unit, rather than word by word. My current research investigates how this is realized during language output, specifically typed text.
