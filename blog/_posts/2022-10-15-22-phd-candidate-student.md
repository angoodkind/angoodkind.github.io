I've been thinking a lot about the title "PhD *Candidate*" versus "PhD *Student*." I've passed my proposal defense, so I am a candidate, but I realized I lost something when I insist I'm no longer a student: I've lost the ability to not know things.

I feel like when I insist that I'm not a student -- after all, the school pays me, I don't pay them -- I also add pressure on myself to know what I'm doing.

But then I realized that one of the best features of my advisor is that he makes me feel comfortable saying "I don't know." Even when I'm halfway through my thesis, and *supposed to* know a lot, there are still times when I don't understand something that maybe I should know or am expected to know. But kt's okay to admit that I don't.

Maybe that's what makes someone a lifelong researcher: never losing the ability to not know things *AND* be okay  with that.
