A few months ago, The Guardian published [an interviewer with Peter Higgs](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system), namesake of the [Higgs Boson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson), or &#8220;God Particle.&#8221; In the interview, Higgs talks about how he wouldn&#8217;t be considered productive, or prolific enough to survive in today&#8217;s academic system, and wouldn&#8217;t have been granted tenure. The upshot of his statement is that the academic system today is obsessed with publishing, and would not reward a genius like Higgs.<img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FqnWn44ghts/TgKPBQA9TqI/AAAAAAAABdM/TRN8CP4if-M/s1600/armchair_philosopher.jpg" width="299" height="300" />

However, I disagree with this assessment of the academic system. Being an academic is not about sitting in an overstuffed leather armchair and conjuring brilliant ideas from the ether. That&#8217;s the domain of the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=armchair%20philosopher&defid=4816655" target="_blank">armchair </a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">philosopher</span>. To me, being an academic means you have an obligation to (a) create ideas that are provable and testable, and (b) share those ideas with the world. There&#8217;s a saying that academics work &#8220;for the greater good&#8221; (as opposed to producing material gains). But to benefit the greater good, one needs to share his or her ideas. The &#8220;greater good&#8221; does not benefit from brilliant ideas that remain just that, brilliant ideas. Rather, the greater good benefits from the dissemination of knowledge.

To be sure, there are <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/10/07/whos-afraid-of-open-access/" target="_blank">issues with the academic publishing business,</a> And these issues certainly merit further discussion, and real changes. Nonetheless, peer-reviewed publishing still constitutes a very effective metric of academic productivity. And a university needs some sort of metric by which to judge output. After all, a professor is an employee of a university, and employees of all stripes and sizes are under the burden of demonstrating their value.

The ironic thing about Peter Higgs&#8217; assertion is that he was employed by Edinburgh University for 36 years, largely because the university did not want to let go of someone who was a candidate for a Nobel Prize. In other words, every system will always find ways to accommodate unique individuals. Edinburgh University clearly recognized Higgs&#8217; singular genius, and paid him a nice salary for 36 whole years, just to prove it!

In sum, there are certainly issues with academia, and with peer-reviewed publishing. Nonetheless, academics have a responsibility to those institutions which support them: To not only create brilliant ideas, but share those ideas, as well.

Now I&#8217;ll stop procrastinating, and get back to my writing&#8230;.
