Below is my answer to the question on Quora, [How well does the age someone starts to learn programming correlate with their long-term technical ability and professional success?](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/How-well-does-the-age-someone-starts-to-learn-programming-correlate-with-their-long-term-technical-ability-and-professional-success)

I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s _necessarily_ any correlation between starting programming when you&#8217;re young, and ultimately ending up a better programmer. However, I&#8217;d like to add one corollary. I believe an important aspect of being a good programmer is fearlessness.

<div>
  To become a better programmer, you can&#8217;t be afraid to screw up. In my experience, the best way to learn was by making mistakes. By learning to program at a young age, you are learning to program when you are more fearless.

      I analogize this to kids who learn to ski at a young age. I never ceased to be amazed at how fast these kids would barrel down the slopes, without even using poles. If the wiped out &#8212; and this certainly occurred &#8212; they got up, wiped the snow off their face, and continued barreling down the slope.

    On the other hand, novice adult skiers proceeded with caution and trepidation, morbidly afraid of a wipeout.

      To circle back to the answer, I believe the most important technical ability in a programmer is not being afraid to mess up. We all know those programmers who wait weeks to push their work to git, because they&#8217;re afraid there could be the slightest bug. And usually, after weeks of delay, there&#8217;s still a bug! So all the worrying and hand-wringing was for nothing.

    <strong>tl;dr:</strong> Fearlessness, in general, is a personality trait. If you have it, you&#8217;ll be a superior programmer. It&#8217;s just easier to express and learn fearlessness when you&#8217;re younger.
