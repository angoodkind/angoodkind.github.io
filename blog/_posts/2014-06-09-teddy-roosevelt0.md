In one of the final episodes of How I Met Your Mother, we learn that Ted Mosby became obsessed with Teddy Roosevelt after reading a biography. The scene is obviously meant to demonstrate how ridiculous and obsessive Ted can be about history, art, etc.<img class="alignright" src="http://castingoutnines.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/theodore-roosevelt.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="309" />

However, I began reading [Edmund Morris&#8217; epic biography of Theodore Roosevelt](http://smile.amazon.com/Theodore-Roosevelt-Modern-Library-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B004DEPH3E/) last week, and have been completely absorbed since. TR&#8217;s life is incredible, and seems to be the perfect storm of a very self-aware, motivated individual, mixed with an upwardly-mobile, opportunity-rich life: a perfect confluence of luck and skill.

It&#8217;s easy to see how one could become obsessed. I think we&#8217;re constantly in search of role models, and TR provides so many shining examples. Further, Morris&#8217; biography goes to great lengths to humanize Roosevelt, so that he [TR] doesn&#8217;t seem superhuman, or unrealistic.Â  In addition, Morris allows the readers to see little bits of Roosevelt in themselves. It makes the reader say, &#8220;If Roosevelt could do this, so can I.&#8221;

This, so far, is my big takeaway: **Roosevelt is so inspiring because of, not in spite of, the fact that he is so much like you and me.** This is a great lesson in leadership, or at least biography-writing.
