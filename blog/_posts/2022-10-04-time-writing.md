I cannot believe it's been over two years since my last post. My life since then has been a steady bombardment of my thesis, job hunting, and physical therapy. Between all of that, I forgot that writing can also be fun. Writing isn't just about defining my thesis' methodology or composing a cover letter. There's also a healthy form of writing.

I have also learned that making too many promises to myself is a great way to give up on everything, curl up in a ball, and watch *The Thomas Crown Affair* again. So I'm not going to do that. I want to write: I want to write about tech andsociety; I want to write short tutorials about coding hacks; I want to write about stupid stuff. Oh, and I also want to spend more time with my wife, take my dog for more walks, get back into painting, and work out more. (See how easy it is to overpromise?!)

Oh right, and also we got a dog! His name is Wallie, and he's the best.
