Here are the books I read in 2015, with some statistics below. I neglected to do this last year, which was disappointing. Here is my <a href="http://adamgoodkind.com/blog/2013-in-books/" target="_blank">2013 list</a>. I got this idea completely from Robin. Here is her <a href="http://www.robincamille.com/2015-01-04-books-i-read-in-2014/" target="_blank">2014 list</a>&nbsp;[Update 12/26/16: And [Robin&#8217;s 2015 list](http://www.robincamille.com/2016-01-12-books-i-read-in-2015/).]

The table is arranged by the order in which I read the books.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistics/Notes</span>

  * In 2015, I read 23 books, for an average reading time of 15.9 days per book.
  * Of the 23 books, 17 (74%) were fiction.
  * Of the 17 fiction books, 5 (29%) can be classified as dystopian stories. I wonder if this is more a reflection of the overall <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=dystopia%2C+dystopian&year_start=1800&year_end=2015&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cdystopia%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cdystopian%3B%2Cc0" target="_blank">zeitgeist</a>, or just my own reading interests. While I&#8217;m none too happy about the current state of politics and policy, I consider myself an optimist at heart.
  * During 2015, I read 2 of the 4 books in William Hertling&#8217;s amazing <a href="http://www.williamhertling.com/books/" target="_blank">Avogaro</a>&nbsp;series, about an A.I singularity in the not too distant future. The books are engaging and well thought out. Hertling knows his technology, and doesn&#8217;t try to create a completely ridiculous/far flung singularity. Rather, the cause of the singularity is subtle and seems within reason, and the far-reaching consequences are profound and well thought out. I mention this for 2 reasons: 
      * Read his books! He&#8217;s fun, his books are cheap and he deserves a lot more readers.
      * This is a good insight into how capricious the publishing industry is. I think Hertling is just as good as an Ernest Cline or Peter Clines, he just hasn&#8217;t been &#8220;discovered&#8221; yet.
