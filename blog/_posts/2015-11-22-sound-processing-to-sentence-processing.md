This is Part 2 of my series of articles chronicling the process of auditory rehabilitation therapy from the perspective of a linguist. Part 1, _Learning Linguistics; Relearning to Hear_, can be found [here](http://adamgoodkind.com/blog/learning-linguistics-relearning-to-hear/).

The past few weeks of therapy have provided a number of interesting experiences. I&#8217;m not sure I can tie them all into a cohesive narrative, so I&#8217;ll just focus on one area: sentence processing as distinct from sound processing.

##### Filling in the Blanks

I am fascinated by how the mind processes language. Further, I&#8217;m fascinated by how we build up a sentence, and go from a series of sound waves to building meaningful words.

A common exercise in rehabilitation therapy is for the therapist to say a sentence with their mouth covered (so I can&#8217;t get anything from lipreading) and have me (try to) repeat the sentence. But an interesting thing happened the other week. Let&#8217;s say the sentence was _The teacher talked to the students._ What I heard was:

\___ \___ \___ \___ \___ students.

But once I heard/understood _students _I immediately could piece together the rest of what I had heard. If my therapist had stopped before _students_, I would have said that I hadn&#8217;t understood _anything_. But since I could piece together the sentence after I understood the final word, it means I clearly got _something_ from the words I thought I completely missed. Clearly my mind was storing those sound patterns as &#8220;something.&#8221; Were they candidate words, each with an assigned probability weight? And once I understood _students_, the probability weights crossed a critical threshold and formed a meaningful sentence.

This experience is distinct from a very similar experience I&#8217;ve had, which reflects the well-known concept of &#8220;[priming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)).&#8221; In that case, a certain stimulus restricts the domain of possibilities, and influences subsequent responses. For example, on the first repetition of a sentence, I got:

\___ \___ \___ a pie

So I knew the domain of the sentence was _food, baking_, etc. This made it much easier to get the other words when the sentence was repeated. Similarly, I&#8217;ve experienced a form of syntactic priming, where I understood the logical or functional structure of the sentence initially, mostly from prosodic cues. In other words, I got:

[SOMEBODY]  [DID AN ACTION]  [TO ANOTHER SOMEBODY]

Upon repetition of the sentence, I could restrict the domain of each word to a noun, a verb and another noun, respectively. Not that it isn&#8217;t super cool that our minds can do this, but it&#8217;s not quite as mystifying as the first example.

In the first example, all of the processing occurred &#8220;on the fly.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t need a second repetition to understand the sentence, but rather backfilled it using some sort of semantic representations of word-forms, that initially I thought I had _completely_ missed. But clearly some form of information was transmitted through those sounds.

All of this seems to be bundled under the rubric of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_processing" target="_blank">sentence processing</a>. I am fascinated by this process and the amazing things our mind naturally does, that my mind is currently relearning to do.

Stay tuned for Part 3, on relearning allophones.
